# Emotion-Recognition-using-CNN

Dataset Used: FER2013 kaggle challenge dataset

The model has been trained on google colab and accuracy obtained on the testing dataset is 64.5%.
The model detects 6 emotions pretty accurately: Neutral, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Sad and Happy.
It faces difficulty in detecting Disgust emotion. I am currently working on resolving this problem.
